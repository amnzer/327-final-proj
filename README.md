# Beat Saber

## Overview

For our ELEC 327 final project, we tried to recreate the game [Beat Saber](https://www.beatsaber.com/) on a setup involving an MSPM0G3507 microcontroller along with various other hardware like an [LED array](https://www.amazon.com/HJHX-Programmable-Individually-Addressable-Raspberry/dp/B0B771455N), [accelerometers](https://www.st.com/en/mems-and-sensors/lsm303agr.html), [a soundboard](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2220), and custom 3D-printed joysticks.

## Repo Structure

What each of the folders in this repo are for:

- game-code: Contains a demo version of the game which can be played in a laptop's terminal.
- microcontroller-code: Contains all of the files in the CCStudio project we made to program our microcontrollers.
- oszs: Contains content from the rhythm game osu, from which we derived the playable charts in our game.
- pcb-code: Contains KiCAD files for the PCB we made.
- website: Contains source code for the website.

## Demo
